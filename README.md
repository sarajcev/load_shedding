## Low-order SFR Model for underfrequency load shedding

This is a simple reduced order system frequency response (SFR) model for designing and analyzing load shedding schemes that are part of the underfrequency relay protection of the electrical power system.

A frequency decline, due to the sudden loss of generating plants, needs to be arrested before it reaches the critical 57 Hz limit (in a system with the 60 Hz nominal frequency). Hence, a load shedding scheme must first identify the total amount of load that needs to be shed in order to arrest the frequency decline and then define pairs of frequency thresholds and load levels that would result with removing this load from the system. This needs to be carried out immediately after the onset of the frequency drop, where the RoCoF and the frequency Nadir play an important role in identifying the severity of the disturbance. It is recommended to shed half of the total load that needs to be removed at the first step, and then distribute the reminding half equally among the several additional steps. However, recommendations vary among utilities and local network conditions can play an important part in determining the viable load schedding scheme.
